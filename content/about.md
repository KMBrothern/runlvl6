Hey, my name is **Keyasha (Key-ah-sha)** and I'm a 2x tech bootcamp ~~survivor~~ graduate and Jr. Developer located in Texas. Although I began my official coding journey in 2015 learning PHP and a few frameworks I didn't feel quite settled there. Recently I've decided to follow a different fork in the road and have transitioned to self-learning development in Swift, iOS, Ruby and Rails.

My first forays into coding were creating/editing my MySpace and Neopets profiles using HTML and CSS in high school and I try to now share that spark of excitement with others. I've been a volunteer mentor with PyLadies ATX as well as a volunteer at Introduce a Girl To Engineering day at UT Austin(with PyLadiesATX)

My current goals are :

* To write clean code that communicates intent
* To create test for my code using Test Driven Development and Unit Testing
* To create and publish apps using Swift/iOS
* To develop ideas using SOLID coding priciples utilizing Ruby/Rails

 I enjoy asking **why** a lot (for clarification & understading) and challenging myself to come up with new ideas and solutions to current issues. I’m always looking to learn new things and stick my hand in the fire (~~at least once~~) while I forge the path ahead.

I am **Keyasha** > I am a **woc in tech** > I am **The Reboot** > I am **Run Lvl 6**

I may occasionaly make reference to 'God/Jesus/insert 'thing' here' in my posts, that's just a differnt part of me. I understand that you may not agree/be offended/other and while that is not my intent, It's ok if you want to click the X on this tab. But I find it neccessary and important for me to be my authentic self in my space while documenting my journey.
