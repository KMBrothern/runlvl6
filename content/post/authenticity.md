This is a professionally risky thing to write, but I feel the risk will be  worth the reward in the end. At  this stage of my life I'm more concerned with the  consequences of disobedience, than I am of closed doors. So I present to you, dear reader, a tale about authenticity.

With the new year upon us, closing old chapters and looking forward to new ones, I would like to get into the resolutions spirit a bit earlier than normal. I've had many different experiences in my life as a working individual. I've worked in the home health industry for over 10 years, have worked retail and most recently attempted a career change into the IT industry. But I think one thing has always held me back, yet seemed to have been the only way to move forward. That was being who they wanted me to be versus who I really am.

I am quiet, but I can be loud. I am smart and curious, but there's a lot that I don't know. I'm an introvert, who with time and patience, can have some extroverted tendencies. I can be sensitive, but also solid as a rock. I am surely a diamond, but still also rough and uncut. I am potential, but I am bound.

Bound by survival's demands to conform or be left behind. Having to be who "they" need, while neglecting who "I" need to be. I am a person, a story, that so many others  can relate to being. Yet, after another rocky year, I've learned so much and opened both my mind and heart to God even when it hurts. It may not be meant for me to understand but everything has been working together for this moment. For me to reclaim myself, in all of my multifaceted glory. The good, bad, polished and still rough parts and combine them into my whole self and present them without fear.

Recently I listened to a sermon given by Sarah Jakes Roberts of One LA church and she spoke about authenticity and it really resonated with me. Especially when she said this:


>Authenticity creates **boundaries**.

>Authenticity creates **standards**.

>Authenticity requires that there are limitations to what you can **do to me**.

>Authenticity dictates that there are limitations to what you can **say to me**.

>And when people **cannot connect** to your authenticity, you should leave them where they stand.


If I am not your culture fit, then that's fine with me. If my name is too "ethnic" for you to consider professional, then that's fine with me. If you don't really want diversity and inclusion at your company, then that's fine with me. If you don't want someone on your team who is willing to share ideas and challenge the status quo, then that's fine with me.

But I will not be your punching bag. I will not be your stepping stone. I will not be meek and shade my own intelligence for the sake of your ego. I will not put rosy spins on ugly situations. I will not let you disrespect me, for any reason, at any time. I will not use time, energy and effort trying to force a square peg in a round hole.

However, in an supportive and inclusive environment I will collaborate with you. I will challenge you. I will grow, learn and share with you. I will be a professional. But most importantly, I will succeed whether you want to have a hand in it or not. I will be the person that I have been called to be and this little light of mine -- I'm going to let it shine. I'm serving my two weeks notice to 2017 and beyond.
