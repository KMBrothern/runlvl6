Learning a new language is often said to be easier once you've previously learned at least one already. Although I worked with PHP and Javascript at my bootcamp, I wouldn't necessarily say that I 'know' either of them to a deep degree. So when I decided to work on something else as I continue my development journey, I chose Swift and later would also like to work on some Ruby.

I chose swift because:
* There's so much information/documentation out there that can really help newbies
* Although it's a new language and had a lot of movement in the beginning, it has begun to stabilize as a language with less frequent releases(less broken projects due to changes)
* Also as a new Mac and iPhone user I wanted to know more about the ecosystem, language and frameworks that allowed me to do most of what I do using apps.
* Last but certainly not least, it looked like a fun way to rejuvenate my journey and re-ignite my passion for development.

So with that said I jumped into Swift headfirst, starting with the book [Hacking With Swift] by Paul Hudson. There are things that I remember from previous languages such as the concepts of variables, loops, data types but there are some things so far that are like 'whaaat' so far in swift.

*Implicity unwrapped optionals
