"Be a sponge", they said. "It will be great", they said. "You'll learn a ton", they said.

But what happens when you begin to realize that everything your sponge self has absorbed isn't good? Or worse, is toxic and melting you from the inside out. While you gasp for air clutching at an ever elusive sky and groping for clarity that is evasive.

**Vivid? Definitely. Dramatic? Maybe a touch.**

But this is a real thing and it happens to more people than you may actually realize.

Thorn #1: Imposter syndrome. Defined as:

> Impostor syndrome (also known as impostor phenomenon or fraud syndrome) is a term coined in 1978 by clinical psychologists Dr. Pauline R. Clance and Suzanne A. Imes referring to high-achieving individuals marked by an inability to internalize their accomplishments and a persistent fear of being exposed as a "fraud".

That's a lot to digest and for me it has been slow going. I'm  extremely hard on myself-- always expecting herculean efforts and **MJ game six of the 1998  NBA Finals** momentous victories -- and when I don't match up to that ideal, I automatically fail. I disregard the records broken on my way, the **victories** that led up to that point and all I tally in the end are injuries and defeats. They are what I celebrate-- my losses become my wins. This is a HUGE problem! By having this one-sided viewpoint I focus on all the things I don't know, all the ways I must be behind(who am I competing against anyway?), all of the ways that I don't fit in.

Sorry, if you came here for some profound knowledge on how to shut the imposter syndrome voice off completely, I don't have such sage advice. However, I am learning that **small steps** will take you up the mountain, the same as giant leaps and they are also more sustainable. Small wins add up giving you momentum that before you know it can snowball into amazing things. I'm finding out that **small** things actually do a tremendous amount to shut down **big** voices.

What I'm saying is this: It will not be instant, nor easy, but it will be **worth it**. You owe it to your past, present, and future self to be kind. To celebrate your victories, to acknowledge that you know more now than you may have even 24 short hours ago. To not compete against anyone but the previous version of **YOU** that didn't know 'the thing' before. 

**Stay in the moment, even if you stay small.**
