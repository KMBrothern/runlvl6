We are all busy, always thinking, rushing, rarely pausing to breathe deeply and just be still. I think the art of stillness is one of my greatest **weaknesses**. By nature I am idealistic, a dreamer, a creative eclectic of sorts. But, I am also a dichotomy within myself. I like tranquility, cool colors and books. Even with both halves of myself, both together and apart, I have not yet mastered the art of stillness.

Often I find myself peering over the edges of self-created visual cliffs, musing to myself  in a half-dazed dream state. So focused in attempting to see what else is out there, that I can easily lose track of where I am right now. So caught up in where I'd like to go that all I can see is failure in where I currently am. **Learning is hard. Coding is hard. Making time is hard. Life is hard.**

But discouragement is easy.

It's easy to overwhelm oneself to the point of exhaustion. It's easy to beat myself up (and maybe you can relate) for all of the things that I don't know that are passing me by. Instead of **congratulating** myself for what I have learned to so far. 

Dejectedness vs. Joy.

I remember being scared and new transitioning into tech in late 2013. I was stressed and overwhelmed by everything I didn't know and was trying to learn. I felt like a I still wasn't smart enough even when I surpassed the goals I was working towards. Because I **chose** to magnify my failure -- instead of celebrate my win.

Even now in 2016, another bootcamp down, another certification added to my name, I still struggle with these feelings. But I can choose to **celebrate** my wins instead of being discouraged at my missteps. Remember discouragement is easy. **Everything else is hard**.

**Choose** the hard things, remember to celebrate and soar like an eagle.
