Learning a new language is often said to be easier once you've previously learned at least one already. Although I worked with PHP and Javascript at my bootcamp, I wouldn't necessarily say that I 'know' either of them to a deep degree. So when I decided to work on something else as I continue my development journey I chose Swift.

I chose Swift because:

* There's so much information/documentation out there that can really help newbies
* Although it's a new language and had a lot of movement in the beginning, it has begun to stabilize as a language with less frequent releases(less broken projects due to changes)
* Also as a new Mac and iPhone user I wanted to know more about the ecosystem, language and frameworks that allowed me to do most of what I do using apps.
* Last but certainly not least, it looked like a **fun** way to rejuvenate my journey and re-ignite my passion for development.

So with that said I jumped into Swift headfirst. There are things that are familiar from previous languages such as the concepts of variables, loops, data types but there are some things so far that are like 'whaaat ðŸ˜µ' for me in Swift

Concepts such as:

* Optionals
* Implicity unwrapped optionals
* Creating a property
